## the story

My "ArtSabers" (or, when they weren't working, "the jankysticks") were a pair of handmade, color-changing lightsabers. They started out as a hasty project for a physical computing class, and then evolved into a photography obsession for the next few years.

The sabers ran on BBC micro:bit microcontrollers and NeoPixel LEDs. Unlike typical homemade lightsabers, they changed color based on 6DOF data, meaning that their color was mapped to the movements of the dancers holding them in long-exposure photographs.
