## The Story

This little project sparked my interest in 3D UX! It was a graphic design assignment: lay out & print an accordion book for any poem, using only one font and hue.

Choosing the inputs (a poem stuffed to the gills with punctuation, a great serif with many weights, a lovely powder blue) was easy. Figuring out how to arrange them into the perfect accordion book was exceptionally tricky. After several iterations missing that special something, inspiration struck. I could give some extra oomph to the turning point in the poem,

> We doctors know a hopeless case if --- 
> listen, there's a hell of a good 
> universe next door; let's go,

by sending it through a "wormhole" in the page.
